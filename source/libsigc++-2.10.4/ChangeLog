  NMake Makefiles: Use Meson-style DLL and .lib naming if requested

  To make things more consistent and less prone to confusion, if 'USE_MESON_LIBS'
  is specified in the NMake command line, build the DLLs and .lib's that are
  named like the Meson counterparts.  Binaries built with Meson+Visual Studio
  and the ones that are built via NMake using 'USE_MESON_LIBS' are
  interchangeable.

  NMake Makefiles: Fix building from Meson-built tarballs

  We need to look for sigc++config.h in $(srcroot)\untracked\MSVC_NMake also, and
  make sure that we do not generate sources unnecessarily.
  
  Also streamline the source generating process into the 'all' target, so there
  is no more need to run the 'prep-git-build' target.

  NMake Makefiles: Support ARM64 Windows builds

  docs/reference/: Update for Doxygen >= 1.8.16

  * docs/reference/meson.build: Doxygen 1.8.16 and later does not store
  tag file names in the html files. This requires changes in meson.build
  and in doc-install.pl (in mm-common). Otherwise references to other modules
  won't be updated in the html files when they are installed.
  * docs/reference/Doxyfile.in: Remove PERL_PATH and MSCGEN_PATH.
  Doxygen since version 1.8.0 does not use them.

  docs/manual/libsigc_manual.xml: Update signal and slot syntax

  Update the syntax of template parameters.
  sigc::signal<void,int> -> sigc::signal<void(int)>. The old syntax is
  deprecated.
  
  Mention lambda expressions.
  
  Although sigc::retype() is a template function, no template parameters
  shall be specified when it's called.
  
  See #59

  Re-work the NMake Makefiles

  Do some cleanups, to improve maintainability and running speed, where:
  
  * Change instances of 'libsigcpp' to 'sigc'
  * "Generate" the build rules for the test and example programs, instead
    of hand-writing them, since they use largely similar rules.
  * Don't use separate rules to  create intermediate directories, so that
    we do not need to re-load the Makefiles unnecessarily

  NMake Makefiles: Add rules to generate sources

  This adds rules to use m4 to generate the headers and sources from their .m4
  counterparts, which allows building directly from  a GIT checkout, after
  running the 'prep-git-build' target.
  
  Update the README.txt file to reflect on this enhancement, and make sure the
  generated headers are also copied when running the 'install' target

2020-06-18  Chun-wei Fan  <fanchunwei@src.gnome.org>

  NMake Makefiles: Add rules to generate sigc.rc and sigc++config.h

  This adds a 'prep-git-build' target which is run before building any of the
  other targets so that this paves the first steps in making the libsigc++-2-10
  branch buildable directly from a GIT checkout with the NMake Makefiles.
  
  Note that unlike the master (3.x) branch, we still need to use m4 to generate
  some sources and headers, which will be covered in the following commit.

2020-06-18  Chun-wei Fan  <fanchunwei@src.gnome.org>

  NMake Makefiles: Support Visual Studio 2019 better

  Make Visual Studio 2019 builds distinct from 2017 builds.  Note that for the
  libsigc++-2-10 branch, we do not distinguish between Visual Studio 2015, 2017
  and 2019 in regards to the built DLL and .lib filenames, since they are
  found to be interchangeable.

2020-06-18  Chun-wei Fan  <fanchunwei@src.gnome.org>

  NMake Makefiles: Use 'md' instead of 'mkdir'

  This is to avoid confusion if we have the UNIX 'mkdir' command in our PATH, such as
  when Cygwin is installed and used.

  'ninja dist' or 'meson dist'. Check if doc-reference.py exists, if not
  maintainer-mode. Add a better error message if mm-common-get is required
  but not found.
  * meson_options.txt: Set default value of the 'warnings' to 'min'.
  Add 'dist-warnings' with default value 'fatal'.
  * tools/dist-cmd.py: Removed file. It's not necessary in add_dist_script()
  when the first parameter is python3.path().

  build: Support NMake builds from Meson tarballs

  This adds inference rules to the NMake Makefiles to also look for the
  sources that are in untracked/, and to ensure that the generated MSVC
  build files (sigc++-config.h and sigc.rc) are copied into
  untracked/MSVC_NMake, so that they can be built properly even with
  NMake.

  meson/Windows: Fix builds when builddir is a subdir of source tree

  It appears that Meson did not construct the paths properly for
  shutil.copy2() when building in a build directory that is a
  subdirectory of the sources, when using meson.current_build_dir(),
  possibly due how path separators are handled.
  
  Fix this by constructing the paths using project_build_root / 'MSVC_NMake'.

  meson.build: Fix 'meson dist' on Windows

  Since we are assured that we are using Python 3.x on when we run Meson, we
  do not really need to look for the 'python3' executable, but we could
  just use whatever Python interpreter that is used to run Meson.
  
  This will fix situations where it is commonly the case where we may have
  multiple Python 3.x installations on Windows (www.python.org, and those
  from Cygwin/mingw-w64), so that Meson really uses one and only one
  Python installation to run everything that is Python-related, which will
  thus fix '[meson|ninja] dist' on Visual Studio builds.

  Meson/MSVC: Support builds directly from GIT checkouts

  It appears that if one uses the m4 that is given by mingw-w64 (and
  perhaps Cygwin), that m4 is enough to generate the sources and headers
  that we need for the build.
  
  So, remove the lines saying building directly from GIT checkouts are not
  supported.

  meson: Relax MSVC version requirement to 2015

  libsigc++ requires a C++-11-compliant compiler, so we can just make the
  build look for Visual Studio 2015 instead of Visual Studio 2017 15.7.
  
  Visual Studio 2013 also works, but since it will spew out loads of
  warnings and the latest C++-11 version of glibmm is not buildable with
  Visual Studio 2013, let's just require Visual Studio 2015.

  This adds a set of NMake Makefiles that can be used to build

  benchmarking programs are supported in addition to building the main
  libsigc++ DLL.
  
  Note that for the C++-11 releases, we name the DLLs and LIBs as
  sigc-vc140-2_0.[dll|lib] or sigc-vc140-d-2_0.[dll|lib] for Visual Studio
  2015 and 2017 builds as these builds link to the msvcp140[d].dll and
  vcruntime140[d].dll C/C++ runtime DLLs.
  
  This set of NMake Makefiles are now dist'ed in place of the Visual
  Studio 2013 project files.

  slot, signal: Avoid compiler warnings from function pointer conversions

  gcc8 -Wextra prints a warning when a single reinterpret_cast is used for

  By adding template specializations that repeats the signal*
  template declarations, though it would be good to avoid the repetition.

  The deprecated mem_fun() has been removed from libsigc+--3.0,

  Improve the documentation of mem_fun()

  * sigc++/functors/macros/mem_fun.h.m4:
  * sigc++/functors/slot_base.h: Make it clear that mem_fun() does not return
  a slot, and 'auto s = sigc::mem_fun(....)' is not equivalent to
  'sigc::slot<....> s = sigc::mem_fun(....)'.
  The confusing documentation was noted by Andrejs Hanins on libsigc-list.

2016-03-01  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

  Approximately a reversion of commit a259b4c7a1753dbc389ee467fa536339ec820223,
  "Remove remaining parts of the sigc::lambda API."
  Differences from an exact reversion: MSVC_Net files are not modified.
  (Probably something ought to be changed in MSVC_Net2013.)
  tests/Makefile.am is not modified-
  is_base_and_derived<> is replaced by std::is_base_of<> in base.h.m4.
  The extern declarations that were previously in select.h.m4 are moved to
  lambda.cc.m4. Without them, sigc::_1 .. sigc::_7 are not included in
  the .so file.
  All code in the header files are inside #ifndef DOXYGEN_SHOULD_SKIP_THIS.

  MSVC Builds: Add "Install" Project

  This makes building the -mm stack easier by copying the headers and the
  built DLL, PDB and LIB files to a location where it can be picked up by
  the gtkmm stack automatically, when they are extracted in a common
  directory.  This is what is currently done with the GTK+ and Clutter
  stacks for Visual Studio builds.

  sigc++config.h.in: Allow Build for MSVC 2013

  MSVC 2013 does not have the C++-11 noexcept, so we need to define that to
  _NOEXCEPT for MSVC 2013.  Plus, since by default MSVC 2013 does not allow
  us to re-define keywords, though they may or may not be supported, we need
  to use the _ALLOW_KEYWORD_MACROS macro to allow this to happen.

  MSVC Builds: Use Windows Line Endings for .sln

  The .sln files need to have Windows/DOS line endings to work properly so
  that Windows can detect the Visual Studio version of the solution file.

  MSVC Builds: Add Forgotten Files

  The MSVC projects now use property sheets, but they were forgotten from
  dist in the previous commits.  Dist them... sorry!

  MSVC Builds: Remove MSVC 2005 and 2008 projects

  They are now unable to build libsigc++ at all, so drop them.

  MSVC Builds: Rename MSVC_Net2010/ to MSVC_Net2013/

  Since libsigc++ now requires MSVC 2013 to build, the MSVC_Net2010 directory
  needs to be renamed to MSVC_Net2013, so that people will not be confused on
  what MSVC version is needed to build libsigc++.  Also remove MSVC_Net2005
  and MSVC_Net2008 from the distribution, as they are no longer able to build
  libsigc++.

  signal_base, trackable: Make move operations noexcept.

2015-09-01  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

  Added test_signal_move.

  This seems to work.

2015-09-01  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

  Added test_slot_move

  This seems to do what it should, acting much like regular slot copying.

2015-09-01  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

  Add test_trackable_move.

  It doesn't segfault, but I'm not sure it's doing what it should.
  See the TODO.

  trackable: move constructor: null the src.

  trackable: Add move operations.

  Also adding them to trackable_callback_list and makeing
  trackable_callback_list noncopyable, which I think is intended.

  C++11: slot*: Add move operations.

2015-09-01  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

  C++11 slot_base: Add move operations.

  Improvements welcome.

2015-09-01  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

  slot_base::operator=(const &): Copy blocked_ too.

  So, if we do
    a = b;
  then a will be blocked if b was blocked. Otherwise it depends on
  whether a was blocked, which seems odd.
  
  If this is not the intended behaviour then we need a comment about it
  in operator=() and a test.

  MSVC Projects: Overhaul The Projects

  The former MSVC 2010 (2012) projects carried over quite a bit of cruft from
  the Visual Studio 2003 days, and there are a number of items that could be
  consolidated into ptoperty sheets, so it's time that the projects get a
  clean up and overhaul.  This is not unlike what was done to the glibmm
  projects some time ago.
  
  Consolidate the projects all into MSVC_Net2010, without subdirectories, as
  the property sheets will separate the object files of the various projects
  into their own places.
  
  This will also likely enable us to support MSVC 2015 in a more efficient
  way.
  
  Also, move the projects configs to MSVC 2013, as that is now the minimum
  version of MSVC required to build sigc++.

2015-08-14  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

  deduce_result_t: Add initial T_return template parameter.

  To make it clearer that this is how to use it.

2015-08-14  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

  tests: Use sigc::deduce_result_t<> instead of deduce_result_type<>::type.

  This removes the last use of sigc::deduce_result_type<>, allowing
  us to change the implementation of sigc::deduce_result_t more easily.

2015-08-14  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

  exception_catch.h: Generate deduce_result_type for the void specializations too.

  I guess this is correct and test_exception_catch still passes.
  Without this, it's actually using, for instance:
    sigc::deduce_result_type<T_arg1, T_Arg2>
  even though sigc::deduce_result_type<> should really be called with a result type
  first, like so:
    sigc::deduce_result_type<T_return, T_arg1, T_Arg2>
  
  Explicitly changing it to use
    sigc::deduce_result_type<T_return, T_Arg1, T_Arg2>
  or
    sigc::deduce_result_type<T_Arg1, T_Arg2>
  instead of just
    deduce_result_type<T_Arg1, T_Arg2>
  doesn't seem to break things either, probably out of luck,
  but changing it to define a type that it actually seems to expect seems
  cleaner, and makes it easier for us to change sigc::deduce_result_type.

2015-08-13  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

  C++11: deduce_result_type.h: Add and use a deduce_result_t<> alias.

  This simplifies the code a bit, by replacing use of this:
    typename deduce_result_type<SomeType1, SomeType2>::type
  with this:
    deduce_result_t<SomeType1, SomeType2>
  
  Note that the alias is a C++11 variadic template.

  Because it now contains no API.
  See https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=752560#c6
  
  The generated sigc++/hide file did not include sigc++/adaptors/hide.h
  so it did not exist as a convenience.

  Remove the (generated) sigc++/retype.h header.

  Because it now contains no API.
  See https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=752560#c6
  
  sigc++/macros/retype_h.m4 did define some m4 macros but these were
  not actually used. The generated sigc++/retype.h file did not
  include sigc++/adaptors/retype.h so it did not exist as a convenience.

  Visual Studio Builds: Move 2010 Projects to 2012

  Since the builds of the *mm stack are going to use C++11, this means that
  we can't build libsigc++ with MSVC 2005~2010 anymore, so we need to update
  the Visual Studio project files to version 2012 (11.0), so that we can
  still support building with Visual Studio, as it does support enough of
  C++11 features that is needed.
  
  Also clean up a little bit by dropping some of the unneeded items from the
  projects and solution files.
  
  These project files are clearly going to need more cleanup, and we should
  drop the MSVC_Net2005 and MSVC_Net2008 folders, and rename MSVC_Net2010 to
  MSVC_Net2012, but this commit will ensure that libsigc++ is indeed still
  buildable with Visual Studio, and we can support Visual Studio 2013 and
  2015 in a more efficient manner.

  C++11: Replace deprecated std::auto_ptr by std::unique_ptr

2015-07-26  Kjell Ahlstedt  <kjell.ahlstedt@bredband.net>

  C++11: visit_each_type<>(): Another check for the same type

  The rest of my suggested additions in bug 752560 comment 3.
  The #include <type_traits> are necessary, if header files are included
  one-by-one, and not via #include <sigc++/sigc++.h>.

2015-07-25  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

  C++11: visit_each<>: Check for the same type as well as the base.

  As suggested by Kjell Ahlstedt here:
  https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=752560#c3
  
  This fixes the test cases.

2015-07-25  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

  C++11: Use std::is_base_of<> instead of our sigc::is_base_and_derived<>.

  As suggested by Kjell's comment here:
  https://git.gnome.org/browse/libsigc++2/commit/sigc++/type_traits.h?id=1e9f65c978be67da71f15231643d504e06a6af3f
  This also removes sigc::is_base_and_derived<> which should cause
  only a slight API change but no ABI change.
  
  Bug #752560

2015-07-19  Kjell Ahlstedt  <kjell.ahlstedt@bredband.net>

  Update README, remove TODO

  * README: Remove lambda from the list of directories.
  Remove the list of compatible compilers. It has become obsolete now that
  libsigc++ uses C++11 features.
  * TODO: Remove. It's obsolete. TODO comments are now scattered in
  the source code.
